    there are two problems with these stylesheets:
    1. they are not scalable 
    2. separation of concerns (HTML | CSS)

    <!-- one way to do is, we can start at this section because section already has an id, and then select the <p> inside the section -->
    <section id="products">
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
      <article>
        <!-- what if you just want to the first one, which the direct child of the products section  -->
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <!-- style this paragraph element that is a direct sibling of this section element -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <!-- what if you want to style all elements that come after the section element -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
