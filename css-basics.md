# Normalizing CSS

- every browser has its own default CSS styles, which can lead to inconsistencies in how web pages are displayed across different browsers.
- to handle this there's a very popular CSS library called Normalize.css.
- Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.
